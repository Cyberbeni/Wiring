# Description

Config files other than `config.general.json` are optional.

Comments are not supported in config files, they are only included in the sample config to help setting up.

Optional parameters that have a value in the sample will default to that value if you omit them.

`*_interval` and `*.timeout` parameters support both numeric values (seconds) and text values ("hours:minutes:seconds" or "minutes:seconds").
